# SCT_CS_01
A Python program to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. It supports encryption, decryption, case sensitivity, and handles non-alphabetic characters. Ideal for learning cryptography basics and improving Python skills. User-friendly and perfect for beginners! ðŸš€ Features Encryption: Converts plain text into cipher text using a user-defined shift value. Decryption: Restores the original message by reversing the shift. Case Sensitivity: Maintains uppercase and lowercase characters. Non-Alphabet Support: Leaves symbols, numbers, and spaces unaltered. User-Friendly: Command-line interface with clear prompts for input.

ðŸ“‹ How It Works

The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the input text by a fixed number of places in the alphabet. For example: Encrypt: "HELLO" with a shift of 3 becomes "KHOOR". Decrypt: "KHOOR" with the same shift returns "HELLO". This program uses modular arithmetic to wrap around the alphabet and ensures all characters are processed correctly.
